The main goal is to be an aid for security professionals , pentesters and web developers to test their security skills in a legal environment And learn about new vulnerabilities and exploit in today world.

## Inspiration

Highly inspired from vulnerable web application for pentesters (DVWA , Webgoat .. etc)

## Contributions

AVWA is in very early stage , All ideas are welcome .. just open issue in this repo with prefix [IDEA] , and we will discuss it in public to implement it. or drop us an email at opensource@shieldfy.io
